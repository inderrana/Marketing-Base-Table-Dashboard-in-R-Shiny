## Analysis Overview

The purpose of this manual is to provide our marketing analysis team with a high-level overview of the relevant statistical summaries made throughout this descriptive analysis project. Provided additionally, are explanations for the different features or variables which we engineered as a team in order to extract additional insight from the dataset, which can be used in future analysis such as segmentation or predictive analytics. 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
